 Here we  predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, we are using Logistic Regression Model for our prediction. 
we have differnt features to detect whether it is rock or Mine 
we have rock as R and mine as M
we split the data Xand Y 
X menas all the data with out target column 
In this data set we take 208 samples and we split the data in to TRAIN data and TEST data 
we create the model as logstic regression model
after create the model we will evaluate the model
we get the accuarcy of data if accuarcy is greater than 85% we will get good predection
we will predict by giving features wehther is it rock or mine
